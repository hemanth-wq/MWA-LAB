        <h2>About this eBook</h2>
        <p><strong>Manufacturing Technology 1</strong> is a branch of mechanical engineering that covers the processes involved in transforming raw materials into finished products. It includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manufacturing processes:</strong> The different processes involved in manufacturing, such as casting, joining, forming, sheet metal work, machining, and assembly.</li>
            <li><strong>Joining methods:</strong> The various methods for joining metals.</li>
            <li><strong>Plastic molding techniques:</strong> The different techniques for molding plastic.</li>
            <li><strong>Sheet metal processes:</strong> The various processes for working with sheet metal.</li>
            <li><strong>Forming techniques:</strong> The various techniques for forming materials.</li>
            <li><strong>Casting processes:</strong> The various processes for casting materials.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Manufacturing technology also refers to the tools, equipment, and systems used to improve production processes. These technologies can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advanced sensors</li>
            <li>Innovative software solutions</li>
